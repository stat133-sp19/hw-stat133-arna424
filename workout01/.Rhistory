Introduction:
Have you ever seen Steph Curry's shots mapped out on a basketball court? No? Well in this project, you finall can! The purpose of this report is to explain how I came up with the shot charts and data about Andre Iguodala,
Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Stephen Curry.
Motivation:
The motivation behind this workout project is to use the data analysis skills we have been developing in stat 133 on a much more massive scale. We have the opportunity to work with a much more complex file structure and upload files to GitHub.
Background:
We will be looking at 5 basketball players in the NBA:
- Andre Iguodala
– Graymond Green
– Kevin Durant
– Klay Thompson
– Stephen Curry
All 5 of these play for the Golden State warriors but some have different positions. To clarify different posiitons and different terms used throughout the workout project, I made a Data Dictionary in the data folder. Although many are self descriptive, some are not, so this dictionary is a very useful guide if one is not familiar with the column headers found in the .csv files for the data.
Data:
I used the curl function within terminal to download the shot data for the five players. Again, there a data dictionary that clarifies the column names. A few examples are:
1. x and y refer to the court coordinates (measured in inches) where a shot occurred.
2. team_name refers to the name of the NBA team.
3. game_date refers to the date that the game took place.
4. season is the NBA season during which the game took place.
5. Opponent is the team that they are playing against.
I then imported the data into R using the following code:
"
`library(ggplot2)
library(grid)
library(dplyr)
library(jpeg)
data_types = c("team_name"="character", "game_date"="character", "season" = "integer", "period"="integer",
"minutes_remaining"="integer", "seconds_remaining"="integer", "shot_made_flag"="factor",
"action_type"="factor", "shot_type"="factor", "shot_distance"="integer", "opponent"="character",
"x"="integer", "y"="integer")
players <- read.csv('./data/shots-data.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE, colClasses=data_types)`

After getting the plots for each player, I exported the graphs (mostly) as PDF's. This is how it was done for Steph Curry. Again, the code for other players follows the same logic:

I then imported the data into the make-shots-data-script.R using the following code:
"
"
After importing the data, I used logical subsetting to change shot_made_flag from n to shot no and from y to shot yes. Among some summaries, I then exported a new file called shots-data.csv into the data file.
After this step was done, I then created a make-shot-charts-script.R file to create visual representations of the players' shot data. I imported the shots-data.csv file:
"
"
After getting this data, I used the ggplot2 library to create visual representation of the courts and players' shot data. The code follows the same type of logic for each player. This was used to general Steph Curry's data:"

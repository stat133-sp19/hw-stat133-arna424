*Quote*

>"For my ally is the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you me the tree the rock everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship."

5. Add parmesan and season and stir

*Special Season*

Not any, but more likely when it is cold.

*Variations*

Yes, there is 'Indian-spiced Cauliflower Soup' which uses different spices like cumin and coriander along with tomatoes found [here](https://smittenkitchen.com/2016/09/indian-spiced-cauliflower-soup/).


**Euclidean Distance**

**Definition**

The **Euclidean distance** between points p and q is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline{pq}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = \((p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n})\) and **q** = \((q_{1},q_{2},...,q_{n})\) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

*d*(**p**,**q**) = *d*(**q**,**p**) = \(\sqrt{(q_{1}-p_{1})^2+(q_{2}-p_{2})^2+...+(q_{n}-p_{n})^2}\)

=\(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (q_{i}-p{i})^2\)

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

||**p**|| = \(\sqrt{p_1^2+p_2^2+...+p_n^2}\) = \(\sqrt{p \cdot p}\) 

where the last expression involves the dot product.
